A QGIS plugin that provides integration with GeoNode.

Main documentation for this plugin, including development docs, available at:

<https://kartoza.github.io/qgis_geonode/>


This plugin was developed by [Kartoza](https://kartoza.com) under contract to [GeoSolutions](https://www.geosolutionsgroup.com/). The initial version of this plugin was developed as part of the Pacific Resilience Knowledge Hub (PACIFIC RESILIENCE NEXUS) that has been contracted by SPC to
GeoSolutions.

The Pacific Resilience Programme (PREP) is a series of projects funded by the World Bank and
implemented at the regional and national level by the Pacific Community, Pacific Island Forum
Secretariat and Samoa, Tonga, Marshall Islands and Vanuatu with aims primarily at
strengthening multi-hazard spatial risk data and information systems including data
decision/support systems/tools as well as strengthen innovative processes to share knowledge
and information.

The project originates from the intention of SPC to strengthen early warning, resilient
investments and financial protection.
