A QGIS plugin that provides integration with GeoNode.

Main documentation for this plugin, including development docs, available at:

<https://geonode.org/QGISGeoNodePlugin/>


This plugin was developed by [Kartoza](https://kartoza.com) under contract to [GeoSolutions](https://www.geosolutionsgroup.com/). 


This initial version of this plugin was being created as an activity of the PRN project, commissioned by the [The Pacific Community (SPC)] and 
with funding from the [World Bank]. Its goal is to develop a QGIS-based client for GeoNode that allows GIS users to 
more easily integrate GeoNode into their workflows.

Original design and implementation was carried out as a joint effort between the [Kartoza] and [GeoSolutions] teams, with
input from the broader community.

The plugin is released as open source software and is available for usage by the QGIS community at large.
