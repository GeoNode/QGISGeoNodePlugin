# About

This plugin is being created as an activity of the PRN project, led by [SPC]. Its goal is to develop a QGIS-based 
client for GeoNode that allows GIS users to more easily integrate GeoNode into their workflows.

Original design and implementation is being done as a joint effort between the [Kartoza] and [GeoSolutions] teams, with
input from the broader community.

The plugin will eventually be made available to the general QGIS audience by being released onto the official plugins
repository.

It is also expected that it will supersede the current QGIS GeoNode integration.
