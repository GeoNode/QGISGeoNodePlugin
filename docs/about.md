# About

This plugin is being created as an activity of the PRN project, commissioned by the [The Pacific Community (SPC)] and 
with funding from the [World Bank]. Its goal is to develop a QGIS-based client for GeoNode that allows GIS users to 
more easily integrate GeoNode into their workflows.

Original design and implementation is being done as a joint effort between the [Kartoza] and [GeoSolutions] teams, with
input from the broader community.

The plugin is released as open source software and is available for usage by the QGIS community at large.
