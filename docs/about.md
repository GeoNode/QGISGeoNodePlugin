# About

This plugin is being created as an activity of the PRN project, with funding by [The Pacific Community (SPC)]. Its goal 
is to develop a QGIS-based client for GeoNode that allows GIS users to more easily integrate GeoNode into their 
workflows.

Original design and implementation is being done as a joint effort between the [Kartoza] and [GeoSolutions] teams, with
input from the broader community.

The plugin is released as open source software and is available for usage by the QGIS community at large.
